## Logic Programming with Streamly

Danny Gratzer's `ds-kanren` package adapted to use streamly instead of `logict`
to show logic programming capability of streamly. `ds-kanren` is an
implementation of the [miniKanren](http://minikanren.org) language.

[These are the
changes](https://github.com/composewell/ds-kanren/commit/87e2e62bdc62c4871753d8d8104802b05ca21db1)
required to use streamly in place of logict.

The original package can be found [on hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/ds-kanren).
The original repo is [on bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/jozefg/ds-kanren/)
